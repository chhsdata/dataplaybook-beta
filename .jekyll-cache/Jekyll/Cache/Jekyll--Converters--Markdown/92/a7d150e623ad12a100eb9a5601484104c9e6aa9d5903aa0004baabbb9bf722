<h2 id="-part-a-crafting-your-data-narrative"><a name="narrative"></a> Part A: Crafting your data narrative</h2>
<p>Sharing your findings with the world is just like telling any good story ‚Äî sometimes it‚Äôs more about the storyteller than the story itself.</p>

<p>All too often, truly meaningful and interesting data projects <strong>fall through the cracks</strong> because they <strong>lack a cohesive narrative</strong> or don‚Äôt convince the audience <strong>why they should care</strong>. Remember, it‚Äôs up to you to decide how to best leverage your data to tell your story in a way that compelling, interesting, and true to you. Here are some guiding questions to get you started:</p>

<h3 id="who-is-your-audience">Who is your audience?</h3>

<p>Your data story can and should change based on your intended audience. The contextualizing information you provide, anecdotes you share, or images you include in a professional journal would be completely different from those you‚Äôd choose to share to a group of high schoolers interested in pursuing a career in STEM. Consider the following questions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>What‚Äôs your relationship to your audience?</strong></li>
    <li>Are you their peer? Did you used to be in their shoes? Do you have anything in common?</li>
    <li><strong>What can you do to understand your audience?</strong></li>
    <li>Create an audience profile for one of your readers/users</li>
    <li>
      <p>Have you interviewed them? Learned their likes/dislikes?</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>What is your ideal medium?</strong></li>
    <li>Your ideal medium is the format through which you implement your product or disseminate your findings, such as:
      <ul>
        <li><em>Digital</em> (web, smart phone applications, social media, etc.)</li>
        <li><em>Formal Print</em> (reports, conferences, PowerPoint/Keynote presentations)</li>
        <li><em>Informal Print</em> (staff meetings, flyers, etc.)</li>
        <li><em>Video</em></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>What do you want them to take away?</strong></li>
    <li>Is your purpose to share something generally exciting (informational) or do your results inform a specific decision or action (decisional)?
      <ul>
        <li>If <em>informational</em>: highlight the findings that are most shocking/interesting to you and your audience</li>
        <li>If <em>decisional</em>: present the findings in a way that obviously supports some change or recommendation
          <ul>
            <li>This often requires you to contextualize your information ‚Äî what else should your audience know to reach your conclusion?</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

<p>Finding  the ‚Äòbest‚Äô way to visualize your data takes time and experience ‚Äî if you‚Äôre a beginner, <strong>focus your efforts</strong> on learning from others and refining your methods to master the art of <strong>translating data to diagrams.</strong></p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>If you just need a quick chart or table, check out these online tools ‚Äî they are simpler to use than the advanced data visualization guides and may be more appropriate for your specific project:</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>- <a href="https://developers.google.com/chart/">Google Charts</a> (interactive charts &amp; simple data tools)<br />  - <a href="https://www.datawrapper.de">DataWrapper</a> (charts, tables, and maps)<br />  - <a href="https://infogram.com">Infogram</a> (beginner-friendly, collaborative, focuses on design thinking principles)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>For more complex data projects, choosing the right visualization is more than just deciding between a pie chart vs. a bar graph ‚Äî it‚Äôs about understanding your audience‚Äôs learning style and design preferences, leaning in to your creative side, and asking for lots of feedback.</p>

<h2 id="-part-c-sharing-with-others"><a name="sharing"></a> Part C: Sharing with Others</h2>

<p>Getting your message out there requires you to <strong>actively share</strong> and <strong>distribute</strong> what you discovered or created.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> While it may seem as if we believe success is a necessary requirement to any ‚Äúgood‚Äù data project,  this could not be further from the truth. No data scientists is free from failure, and data projects with less-than-ideal or confusing outcomes ‚Äî besides being incredibly common ‚Äî are immeasurably valuable to share with others. As a community, we will never learn from each other‚Äôs experiences if we do not communicate our failures.</p>

<h3 id="building-the-data-community-at-chhs">Building the Data Community at CHHS</h3>

<p>Across the agency, there are a few existing groups and initiatives that exist to <strong>help you leverage your department‚Äôs resources</strong> to publicize your findings. Take advantage of the resources available to you, ask for help from those who‚Äôve done this before, and be proud of yourself for completing your project!</p>

<ul>
  <li>There are a number of ‚Äú<strong>Data Showcase Teams</strong>‚Äù across the agency. They organize events to build a shared understanding of data, celebrate successes and failures, and lear from each other‚Äôs projects.</li>
  <li>Your department or program may have an <strong>established visual and brand style</strong> that provides credibility to your data analysis, thus increasing its chances of publication. These styles standardize color themes, fonts, and citation formats across agency publications.</li>
  <li>A repository of <strong>CHHS data assets</strong> is currently underway to streamline creation, maintenance, and sharing of each department‚Äôs resources.</li>
