<p>With over 33,000 employees, we at CHHS make up the largest agency under Californiaâ€™s executive branch. Our 13 departments collectively have access to an unprecedented amount of data â€“ it is our mission to use this data to improve the programs and services we deliver to our clients, amplify the impact of the data reports we create, and to create an organizational culture that is focused on data-driven decision making.</p>

<h2 id="whats-inside">Whatâ€™s inside</h2>

Every member of CHHS â€“ from the data novice to the data expert â€“ will find something useful here, whether itâ€™s learning how to analyze a dataset for the first time or refining your knowledge of advanced data visualization.</p>
